        "In the realm of statistical analysis, regression serves as a methodological approach aimed at forecasting the value of a dependent variable denoted as 'y', based upon the values exhibited by one or more independent variables represented by 'X'.\n",

        "Linear Regression is a way to predict the relationship between two varibles by assuming a linear connection between the independent and dependent variables.\n",

        "* It is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm. It takes labelled data as its input to predict the output.\n",
